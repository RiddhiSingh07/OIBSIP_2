                                Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the attack.
                                They also released a video of the assailant Adil Ahmad Dar, a 22-year-old from Kakapora who
                                had joined the group a year earlier. Dar's family had last seen him in March 2018, when he
                                left his house on a bicycle one day and never returned. Pakistan denied any involvement, though
                                Jaish-eMohammed's leader, Masood Azhar, is known to operate in the country.
